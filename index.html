	<h1>What is Code Quest?</h1>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/who-we-are/community/codequest.html">Lockheed Martin Code Quest</a> is a programming competition held every year for High School students. It takes place at various Lockheed Martin facilities and there are both regional and national winners. Participation is free of charge and students are encouraged to work on and solve problems released in previous years.</p>
	<p>This website keeps track of the problems that we have solved and how we solved them. This website is updated automatically through the program that we wrote codenamed <a href="https://github.com/CodeQuest2017/Judge">Judge</a>. We can easily update all of the information on this website with the latest test results by running the judge client.</p>
	<p>Use the navigation above to directly view each problem repository, or alternatively scroll below to view the in-depth analysis of the problems and our solutions for each.</p>
